# Cash Planner App
Technologies: React | Express | NodeJS | PostgreSQL

Developed with the goal to help users better manage their finances and therefore lead to greater financial health. I utilised three main technologies React for the client-side NodeJS for the server-side and PostgreSQL for Database integration.

The Cash Planner App also allows users to register and login with their unique credentials with the use of PassportJS while the PostgreSQL database securely stores the passwords hashed and salted using bcryptJS. This App shows my understanding of React Components, Props and Use State.

This App utilises Googles React Charts which help visually break down a users incoming and outgoings as well as a calendar break down to show users how much they can save each day to reach their financial goals.
